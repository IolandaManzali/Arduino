## Overview

The [Arduino Cloud for Business](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/software-arduino-iot-cloud/) is an Arduino IoT Cloud plan dedicated to companies and industrial clients wanting enhanced features in terms of device management, Role-Based-Access-Control, fleet management and safe remote access.

In this article, you will get a general overview of the major features of the Arduino Cloud for Business. However, if you are not familiar with Arduino IoT Cloud, we strongly recommend you to take a look at the following documentation: 
* To find all tutorials & articles, visit the [Arduino IoT Cloud Documentation page](https://docs.arduino.cc/cloud/iot-cloud).
* For a technical overview, list of features, and API guide, visit the [Arduino IoT Cloud Cheat Sheet](https://docs.arduino.cc/cloud/iot-cloud/tutorials/technical-reference).
* For API & SDK Documentation, visit the developer reference at[ Arduino IoT Cloud API](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/iot/api/).

## Goals
* Get in-depth information about how the Arduino Cloud for Business works
* Learn about the multiple dedicated features Arduino Cloud for Business provides
* Learn how to get started with Arduino Cloud for Business

## Required Software
* [Arduino Cloud for Business](https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans#business)


## Get Started With Arduino Cloud For Business

In order to get started with Arduino Cloud for Business, you need to [subscribe a plan](https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans#business). 

The Arduino Cloud for Business plan consists of two main subscriptions: 
* **Enterprise Base Plan.** It includes all the Arduino Cloud for Business features, like data plan, fleet management, Role-based-acess-control, Web Editor with Over-the-air updates, IoT Cloud with dashboards etc. Multiple of 50 devices can be connected under the Enterprise Base Plan â€“ and you can always [contact our team](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/contact-us) for a tailored plan to accelerate your IoT solutions.
* **Optional Add-ons.** To address additional needs, Arduino Cloud for Business can be customized with optional add-ons. Check the [dedicated section](#Optional-Add-Ons) of this tutorial to learn more. 

If you do not need any tailored plan, go to [Arduino Cloud for Business page](https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans#business) and select **Purchase**. You will be then asked to login with your Arduino credentials. If you do not have an account yet, feel free to create a new one.

It is now time to customize your plan. Select the billing frequency you prefer and the number of Things (and so devices) that you would like to connect with your Arduino Cloud for Business workspace and click on **Continue**. 

![Customize your plan](assets/plan-customization.png "Customize your plan")

Go on by flagging the optional add-ons that you may need in your projects and click on **Add billing information**. Do you want to learn more on these add-ons? Check the [dedicated section](#optional-add-ons) of this getting started.

In the next steps, add all your billing and payment information and purchase your plan. 

Now you are ready to get started with your brand new Arduino Cloud for Business plan. Check the next sections to understand how to set-up your account and which features are included in your plan.  

### Join A Space

Once your plan has been successfully purchased, you will be asked to define the company / space name for your workspace. You are free to modify it in a second time by navigating to `Arduino Cloud > General Settings > Space information > Edit info > Name`.

Your Arduino Cloud for Business plan comes with two spaces by default: 
* **My Cloud**. My Cloud is a private space that is automatically created once a Arduino Cloud for Business plan is purchased. You can use this space for personal projects you do not want to share with all your team. This space is free and includes two Things, unlimited dashboards and 100MB of Sketch storage by default, but it can be further extended and customized by purchasing any [Individual plan on Arduino Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc/plans).
* **Shared space**. A shared space is the company space that you can use with all your team. As a matter of fact, a shared space can have any number of members, who can all access the resources inside of it. The level of access and specific permissions can be customized by the Space Admin (see [Invite members into your space section](#invite-members-into-your-space) to learn more).
