## Overview

This user manual will guide you through a practical journey covering the most interesting features of the Arduino Nicla Sense ME. With this user manual, you will learn how to set up, configure and use this Arduino board.

## Hardware and Software Requirements
### Hardware Requirements

- [Nicla Sense ME](https://store.arduino.cc/products/nicla-sense-me) (x1)
- Micro USB cable (x1)

### Software Requirements

- [Arduino IDE 1.8.10+](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), [Arduino IDE 2.0+](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software), or [Arduino Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor)
- To create custom Machine Learning models, the integrated Machine Learning Tools of the [Arduino Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/iot/) are needed. In case you do not have an Arduino Cloud account, you will need to create one first.

## Product Overview

Introducing the Arduino® Nicla Sense ME, our most compact design to date, housing an array of high-quality industrial grade sensors in a remarkably small package. This versatile device allows you to monitor essential process parameters like temperature, humidity, and movement accurately. Equipped with a 9-axis inertial measurement unit and the option for Bluetooth® Low Energy connectivity, it becomes an ideal choice for crafting your next Bluetooth® Low Energy enabled project. Harness the power of the onboard Bosch sensors, including BHI260AP, BMP390, BMM150, and BME688, to create your very own industrial grade wireless sensing network.

### Board Architecture Overview

The Nicla Sense ME features a robust and efficient architecture that integrates a range of sensors packed into a tiny footprint. It features four industrial grade Bosch sensors that can accurately measure rotation, acceleration, pressure, humidity, temperature, air quality and CO2 levels.
