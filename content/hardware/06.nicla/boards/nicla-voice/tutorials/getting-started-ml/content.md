## Overview

The Arduino® Nicla Voice runs audio inputs through the powerful Syntiant NDP120 Neural Decision processor, which mimics human neural pathways to run multiple AI algorithms and automate complex tasks. In other words, it recognizes different events and hears keywords simultaneously. It is capable of understanding and learning its surrounding sounds.

To make use of these keyword triggers, such as blinking the LED when the board recognizes a specific word, a machine learning model is required. With the [Machine Learning Tools](https://cloud.arduino.cc/machine-learning-tools/) powered by Edge Impulse® and integrated in Arduino Cloud, it is possible to build, train and easily deploy the machine learning model to the Nicla Voice. This tutorial will explain how to start with the board, test the default built-in sketch, and create your own models.

## Goals

The goals of this tutorial are:

- Test the built-in example to check that the board is working well
- Learn how to capture audio to train a machine learning model
- Learn how to train a machine learning model
- Learn how to export the model to be used with the Nicla Voice
- Learn how to test the model to see if it is working as it should be

## Hardware & Software Needed

- Arduino IDE ([online](https://create.arduino.cc/) or [offline](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)).
- [Arduino Nicla Voice](https://store.arduino.cc/nicla-voice) (x1)
- [Arduino Cloud](https://cloud.arduino.cc/)

## Testing the Built-in Example

The Nicla Voice comes pre-flashed with a wake up word detection demo. This demo can be found in the Arduino IDE, under **File->Examples->NDP->AlexaDemo**. To test this sketch, simply connect the Nicla Voice to a computer or an alternative power source, and say "Alexa". This should make the on-board LED blink. If there is no response from the board, try with closer proximity or try speaking louder. In this tutorial, we are going to replicate this behavior using our custom Machine Learning model.

Now let's take a look at how to create a machine learning model using the Machine Learning Tools integration.

## The Machine Learning Model

To train a machine learning model to classify audio, we first need to feed it with an audio sample, which will be a sound that it should recognize. The model will be trained using a concept called *supervised learning*. With *supervised learning*, we train the model with data already known and tell it while it's "practicing" its predictions if they are correct or not. This is normally known as the *training* process. For the training on *supervised learning*, objects are labeled beforehand with their names, which you will see when we get to the audio recording section.

### What Is Overfitting and How to Avoid It

If a machine learning model is overfitting, it means that it is too well geared toward your training data and it will not perform well with unseen input data. This is a common pitfall in machine learning. You need some variation in the training dataset and adjust the parameters, so that the model does not just learn all input data by heart, making the classification based on that, but it will rather learn the concept that makes up an object or a sound.

Finding the proper configuration for your application often requires trial and error. Check [this article](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/tips-and-tricks/increasing-model-performance) to learn more about how to improve poorly performing machine learning models.

### Creating a Custom Machine Learning Model

With the Nicla Voice, it is possible to train your own models for voice recognition and use them with the board. This will allow the Nicla Voice to detect words or phrases based on your recordings. First, if you do not already have an Arduino Cloud account, please go [here and create one](https://cloud.arduino.cc/home/). You can then access the Machine Learning Tools integration via the Arduino Cloud, as shown in the image below. 

![Machine Learning tools option in Arduino Cloud](assets/arduino-cloud-ML.svg)

With the account set up, create a new project and proceed to the next step to capture data for the model.

### Capturing Data for the Model

There are multifarious methods for capturing sound for the model with the Machine Learning Tools integration. Navigate to the "Data acquisition" page and pick the preferred method for capturing audio.

![Data acquisition page](assets/data-acquisition-page.svg)

This tutorial will go through how to capture audio from the phone directly to the Machine Learning model. It is possible to capture audio from the Nicla Voice and upload it to the Machine Learning model by using the NDP library's "Record and Stream" example.

On the data acquisition page, press the "Let's collect some data" button. Now select the "Show QR code" option in the "Use your mobile phone" section.

![Collecting data for the model](assets/data-collection-option.svg)

Scan the QR code with your phone and it will automatically connect. Set the options as shown below and you are ready to start recording audio for the Machine Learning model. On your phone, select the option for recording audio and give the appropriate permissions. There should now be a button on the screen that says "Start recording". Before recording, set the label of the recordings to match the phrase you want to have recognized, this will simplify the data sorting.

![Recording options](assets/record-data-options.svg)

When a recording is made on the phone, it will automatically show up on the webpage. First start by recording around five minutes of the phrase you want to have recognized, for this tutorial "Ciao Nicla" will be used. Try to vary the distance from the microphone, the pronunciation and the inflection when speaking the phrase to give the model a wider definition of the phrase that should be recognized. If you want to make the model more accurate have multiple people recording the same phrase, going through the same process of varying the distance from the microphone, the pronunciation and the inflection.

Once this is done, record another five minutes of random words that are not the desired phrase and set the label for these recordings as "unknown". This will help you with the training of the model later. And, to give the model a better understanding of which sounds not to recognize as the trigger, also record five minutes of background and ambient noise. Set the label of these recordings as "noise". The more data collected, the better the model can be trained to recognize the required sentence. Feel free to collect as many of these three different categories as needed.

![Data collected](assets/data-acquired.svg)

Make sure to have a good training/test data split ratio of around 80/20. The test data is used to test the model with "unseen" data after the training has finished. If you have an overfitting model, you may see high accuracy in the training results but poor performance in the testing results. If that is the case, you may have to tweak the parameters or collect more/better training data. More information on this can be found in this [documentation](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/tips-and-tricks/increasing-model-performance).

### Create an Impulse

Now that we acquired the data samples, we can move on to designing the Impulse. In a nutshell, an Impulse is a pipeline that the model will use for training and it consists of an input block, a processing block and a learning block. The input block indicates the type of data being used in the model, which will be audio in this case. The processing block extracts meaningful features from your data. The Audio Syntiant processing block we are using in this tutorial extracts time and frequency features from the audio used in the model. The learning block uses a neural network classifier that will take the input data and the audio that was captured in the previous step and provides a probability that indicates how likely it is that the input data belongs to a particular class as its output.

Now that we have the data samples, we can move on to designing the Impulse. An Impulse is in a nutshell the pipeline that the model will use for training. Consisting of an input block, processing block and a learning block. The input block indicates the type of data being used in the model, which will be audio in this case. The processing block extracts meaningful features from your data. The Audio Syntiant processing block we are using in this tutorial extracts time and frequency features from the audio used in the model. The learning block uses a neural network classifier that will take the input data, the audio that was captured in the previous step, and then give us a probability that indicates how likely it is that the input data belongs to a particular class.

In the menu navigate to "Create Impulse" under "Impulse Design" and add an Audio processing block, which will be "Syntiant" in this case, as well as a Classification block. The page should now look like the image below.

![Impulse design page](assets/impulse-design-page.svg)

Under "Impulse Design" go to the "Syntiant" page. In the "Parameters" settings the "Features extractor" has to be set to "log-bin". This means that the window will be a fixed size. The window is the size of the data that will be processed per classification.

![Syntiant settings](assets/syntiant-options.svg)

Now select the "Generate features" tab on the "Syntiant" page. On this page, press the green "Generate features" button. If you have collected a total of fifteen minutes of data as suggested in the previous step, this will take some time to complete. Now the data can be visualized on the right. Here you can easily see if the different classes of collected data are separated into clear groups with respect to their different classes; this can help you figure out if the desired phrase will be easily differentiated from the noise and random words recorded.

![Generating features with syntiant](assets/features-generation.svg)

Now that the settings are correct and we have the data for the model, it is time to train.

### Training the Model

Go to the "Classifier" tab under "Impulse design". We can keep the default settings here and press the "Start training" button. On the right, you can see the progress of the training, this process will also take some time to complete. Once it is complete, the performance of the model's training can be seen in the image below.

![Stats from the generated features](assets/generated-features-stats.svg)

Ideally, you want to get as close to 100% accuracy as possible for each class. If the results are poor, the sound recorded may not be representative of the audio that it is being classified as. The audio that is incorrect should then be removed from the data set and replaced if the data set becomes too small.

### Deploying the Model

The model is now ready to be built and deployed. Go to the "Deployment" page, select the "Arduino Nicla Voice" under "Build firmware" and set the posterior parameters. Click the "Find posterior parameters" button. In the window that pops up select all keywords that we have created in the steps before. We can keep the calibration settings to "No calibration". Then press the green "Find parameters" button and, when the job is done, close this window.

![Deployment on Machine Learning Tools Integration](assets/deployment-first-step.svg)

Now it is time to prepare the model created to upload it to the Nicla Voice. Select the Nicla Voice firmware and press the green "Build" button. When the building is done you will receive a .zip file containing the model built for the Nicla Voice. Now that you have the Machine Learning model built, we need to set up the Arduino IDE installing the appropriate core and CLIs.

![Model finished building on Machine Learning Tools Integration](assets/deployment-finished.svg)

### Setting up the Arduino IDE

Make sure the latest version of the Arduino IDE is installed. The IDE can be downloaded [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). Within the Arduino IDE install the core for Nicla. Go to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager**, in the board's manager section search for **Arduino Mbed OS Nicla Boards** and install it.

### Installing Additional Dependencies

To easily flash any Machine Learning model created with Machine Learning Tools integration onto the Nicla Voice, we need to install the Arduino CLI and Edge Impulse® CLI. Follow [this article](https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/docs/development-platforms/officially-supported-mcu-targets/arduino-nicla-vision#installing-dependencies) from Edge Impulse® to install both properly.

### Uploading the Model

Now that everything needed for flashing the firmware and the model to the Nicla Voice is installed, you can finally flash the board with your model. Extract the files that were packed into the .zip file received from Edge Impulse® when the model was built into a folder. At this point, run the right "flash" file for your OS on the machine you are using, as reported in this list:

- Use **flash_windows.bat** if you are using a PC
- Use **flash_mac.command** if you are using a MAC
- Use **flash_linux.sh** if you are using a Linux machine

If there is any issue in the process, try to run these as administrator. A command window will appear where you can follow the status of the installation.

### Testing It Out

To make sure everything is working open the Arduino IDE, select the correct port that the board is connected to, and open the serial monitor. If there is nothing in the serial monitor try pressing the reset button on the Nicla Voice once. The information about the files and the model that is loaded onto the board should now be printed on the serial monitor.

![Correct firmware and model loaded on the Nicla Voice](assets/fw-loaded-serial-monitor.svg)

Now you can go ahead and say your wake up words to the Nicla Voice. The board should then blink the blue LED when a sound is registered. If the LED does not blink try moving closer to the Nicla Voice or pronounce the wake up words differently. The board will print what class it thinks the sounds recognized belongs to, as seen in the image below. This makes it easy to see if the board will recognize the desired phrase or if it is recognized as a different class. If the board has problems recognizing the right phrase it might be a good idea to take another look at the model and the data that has been collected.
