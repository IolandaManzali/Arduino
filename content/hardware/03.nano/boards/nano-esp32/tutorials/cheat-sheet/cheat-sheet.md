The **Arduino Nano ESP32** is the first Arduino to feature an ESP32 SoC as its main microcontroller, based on the [ESP32-S3](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32-s3). This SoC is found inside the **u-blox® NORA-W106** module and provides both Bluetooth® & Wi-Fi® connectivity, as well as embedding an antenna.

![Nano ESP32 overview](assets/nano-esp32-overview.png)

In this document, you will find information regarding features your board, and links to resources. 

***Note that this board is compatible with many ESP32 examples out of the box, but that the pinout may vary. You can find the complete API at [ESP32-S3 API reference](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/api-reference/index.html).*** 

## NORA-W106 (ESP32-S3)

![NORA-W106 module.](assets/nano-esp32-wifi.png)

The Nano ESP32 features the **ESP32-S3** system on a chip (SoC) from Espressif, which is embedded in the **NORA-W106** module. The ESP32-S3 has a dual-core microprocessor Xtensa® 32-bit LX7, and has support for the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi® band as well as Bluetooth® 5. The operating voltage of this SoC is 3.3 V.

The NORA-W106 also embeds an antenna for Bluetooth® and Wi-Fi® connectivity.

### Memory

The Nano ESP32 has
- 384 kB ROM
- 512 kB SRAM
- 16 MB of Flash (external, provided via GD25B128EWIGR)

## Datasheet

The full datasheet is available as a downloadable PDF from the link below:

- [Download the Nano ESP32 datasheet](/resources/datasheets/ABX00083-datasheet.pdf)

## Nano ESP32 Core

This board is based on the [Arduino ESP32 Core](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-esp32), that is derived from the original ESP32 core. It provides a rich set of examples to access the various features on your board, which is accessed directly through the IDE.

![ESP32 examples in the IDE.](assets/esp32-examples.png)

To install the core, go the **board manager** and search for **Nano ESP32**. For more detailed instructions to install the core, please refer to the [Getting Started with Nano ESP32](/tutorials/nano-esp32/getting-started-nano-esp32) article.

## Bootloader Mode
The Nano ESP32 has a feature that we call bootloader-mode, what this means is that you are able to put the board in a sort of recovery mode by double pressing the reset button while the board is powered on.

This mode is useful if you've uploaded a sketch that produces some unwanted behaviour. Maybe the sketch causes it to become undetectable by your computer, or maybe its an HID sketch that took over your keyboard and mouse and you need to regain control of your computer. It lets you turn the board on without actually running any sketch.

To enter bootloader-mode, press the reset button, and then press it again once you see the RGB LED flashing. You'll know that you've successfully entered bootloader-mode if you see the RGD LED pulsing slowly.

## MicroPython

The Nano ESP32 has support for MicroPython, a micro-implementation of Python® that can easily be installed on your board.

To get started with MicroPython, please visit [MicroPython 101](/micropython-course), a course dedicated towards learning MicroPython on the Nano ESP32.

In this course, you will fundamental knowledge to get started, as well as a large selection of examples for popular third-party components.

## Arduino IoT Cloud

Nano ESP32 is supported in the [Arduino IoT Cloud](https://create.arduino.cc/iot/) platform. You can connect to the cloud either through "classic" Arduino, using the C++ library, or via MicroPython:

- [Getting Started with Arduino IoT Cloud (classic)](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/getting-started/iot-cloud-getting-started)
- [MicroPython with Arduino IoT Cloud](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/getting-started/iot-cloud-micropython)


## API

The Nano ESP32 can be programmed using the same API as for other Arduino boards (see [language reference](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/)).

However, the ESP32 platform provides additional libraries and built-in functionalities that may not available in the standard Arduino API.

For more information, see the [ESP32-S3 API](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/api-reference/index.html#)

### Peripherals API

To learn more about the ESP32-S3's peripherals (e.g. ADC, I2C, SPI, I2S, RTC), refer to the [Peripherals API section](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/index.html#).

### Sleep Modes

The Nano ESP32 can be programmed to draw a minimal amount of power, making it suitable for power constrained designs, such as solar/battery powered projects. 

The [Sleep Modes](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/api-reference/system/sleep_modes.html) section in the ESP32 docs explains how to configure your board to draw minimal power, introducing the **light sleep** and **deep sleep**

## Power Considerations

![Nano ESP32 Power Tree.](./assets/nano-esp32-powertree.png)

To power the Nano ESP32 you may either use a USB-C® cable, or the VIN pin. When using the VIN pin, use voltages within the range of 5-18 V as the **MP2322GQH** converter on the board may otherwise be damaged. 

### Input Voltage (VIN)

- If you're using the USB-C® connector you must power it with 5 V.
- The recommended input voltage on the VIN pin is 6-21 V.

### Operating Voltage

The internal operating voltage of the ESP32-S3 SoC is 3.3 V, and you should not apply voltages higher than that to the GPIO pins.

### 5V Pin / VUSB

The Nano ESP32 is the first board to not feature a **5V** pin. It has instead been replaced with VBUS, which is a more accurate description of the pin's capabilities.

`VBUS` provides 5 V whenever powered via USB. If powered via the VIN pin, it is disabled. This means that while powering the board through the VIN pin, you can't get 5 V from the board, and you need to use a logic level shifter or an external 5 V power supply.

This measure is taken to prevent the board's microcontroller from accidentally receiving 5 V, which will damage it.

## Pins

The Nano ESP32 has two headers: the **analog** and **digital**. Listed here are the **default** pins that comply with previous Nano form factor designs.

The following pins are available on the board:

Note that all pins can be used as GPIO, due to the ESP32's flexibility.

### Digital

The Nano ESP32 has 14 digital pins (D0-D13), that can be read by using `digitalRead()` or written to using `digitalWrite()`.

| Pin      | Type    | Function                             |
| -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| D13/SCK  | Digital | **SPI** Serial Clock / LED Built in  |

| D3       | Digital | GPIO                                 |
| D2       | Digital | GPIO                                 |
| D0/RX    | Digital | GPIO 0 / **UART** Receiver (RX0)     |
| D1/TX    | Digital | GPIO 1 / **UART** Transmitter (TX0)  |

Note that all analog pins can be used as digital pins as well, but not vice versa.

### Analog

There are 8 analog input pins on the Nano ESP32, with 2 reserved for I2C communication (A4/A5). The ESP32-S3 embeds two SAR ADCs, `ADC1` and `ADC2`, where each ADC uses 4 channels each. 

| Pin | Type   | Function                                    | ADC channel |
| --- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| A0  | Analog | Analog input 0                              | `ADC1_CH0`  |
| A1  | Analog | Analog input 1                              | `ADC1_CH1`  |
| A2  | Analog | Analog input 2                              | `ADC1_CH2`  |
| A3  | Analog | Analog input 3                              | `ADC1_CH3`  |
| A4  | Analog | Analog input 4 / **I2C** Serial Datal (SDA) | `ADC2_CH1`  |
| A5  | Analog | Analog input 5 / **I2C** Serial Clock (SCL) | `ADC2_CH2`  |
| A6  | Analog | Analog input 6                              | `ADC2_CH3`  |
| A7  | Analog | Analog input 7                              | `ADC2_CH4`  |

***Please note that `ADC2` is also used for Wi-Fi® communication and can fail if used simultaneously.***

For more details, see [Analog to Digital Converter (link to Espressif docs)](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v4.4/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/adc.html).

### PWM

Pulse width modulation (PWM) is supported on **all digital pins (D0-D13)** as well **as all analog pins (A0-A7)**, where the output is controlled via the `analogWrite()` method. 

```arduino
analogWrite(pin,value);
```

***Due to timer restrictions, only 4 PWM signals can be generated simultaneously.***

### Boot Pins

To enter bootloader mode (chip boot mode), you can use either the BOOT0 (B0) or BOOT1 (B1) pins, which are connected to the ESP32-S3's `GPIO0` and `GPIO46`. 

![Boot pins.](assets/nano-esp32-boot.png)

Shorting these to GND + pressing the reset button will enter a bootloader mode. Note that while shorting these pins, a corresponding LED will light up.

***Some boards from the first limited production batch were assembled with a different RGB LED which has the green and blue pins inverted. Read our full Help Center article [here](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/9589073738012)***

You can read more about different this in the [Strapping Pins section](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3_datasheet_en.pdf#page=23) in the ESP32-S3's datasheet.

## I2C

![I2C Pins](assets/nano-esp32-i2c.png)

The default pins used for I2C on the Nano ESP32 are the following:

| Pin | Function | Description          |
| --- | -------- | -------------------- |
| A4  | SDA      | **I2C** Serial Data  |
| A5  | SCL      | **I2C** Serial Clock |

To connect I2C devices you will need to include the [Wire](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/communication/wire/) library at the top of your sketch.

```arduino
#include <Wire.h>
```

Inside `void setup()` you need to initialize the library, and initialize the I2C port you want to use.

```arduino
Wire.begin() //SDA & SDL
```

And to write something to a device connected via I2C, we can use the following commands:

```arduino
Wire.beginTransmission(1); //begin transmit to device 1
Wire.write(byte(0x00)); //send instruction byte 
Wire.write(val); //send a value
Wire.endTransmission(); //stop transmit
```

## SPI

![SPI Pins](assets/nano-esp32-spi.png)

The Nano ESP32's SPI pins are listed below:

| Pin   | Function | Description                   |
| ----- | -------- | ----------------------------- |
| D10\* | CS       | Chip Select                   |
| D11   | COPI     | Controller In, Peripheral Out |
| D12   | CIPO     | Controller Out, Peripheral In |
| D13   | SCK      | Serial Clock                  |

\*Any GPIO can be used for chip select.

The following example shows how to use SPI:

```arduino
#include <SPI.h>

const int CS = 10;


void setup() {
  pinMode(CS, OUTPUT);

  SPI.begin();

  digitalWrite(CS, LOW);

  SPI.transfer(0x00);
  
  digitalWrite(CS, HIGH);
}

void loop() {
}
```

## UART

The pins used for UART on the Nano ESP32 are the following:

| Pin | Function | Description          |
| --- | -------- | -------------------- |
| D0  | RX       | Receive Serial Data  |
| D1  | TX       | Transmit Serial Data |

![Nano ESP32 UART Pins](./assets/nano-esp32-uart.png)

To send and receive data through UART, we will first need to set the baud rate inside `void setup()`. Note that when using the UART (RX/TX pins), we use the `Serial1` object.

```arduino
Serial1.begin(9600);
```

To read incoming data, we can use a while loop() to read each individual character and add it to a string.

```arduino
  while(Serial1.available()){
    delay(2);
    char c = Serial1.read();
    incoming += c;
  }
```

And to write something, we can use the following command:

```arduino
Serial1.write("Hello world!");
```

## IO Mux & GPIO Matrix

The ESP32-S3 SoC features an IO mux (input/output multiplexer) and a GPIO matrix. The IO mux acts as a data selector and allows for different peripherals to be connected to a physical pin. 

The ESP32-S3 chip has 45 physical GPIOs, but many more digital peripherals. The IO mux provides the flexibility of routing the signals to different GPIOs, thus changing the function of a specific pin.

![Peripheral IO MUX](./assets/nano-esp32-iomux.png)

This technique is well known and applied within ESP32 boards, but on the Nano ESP32 we use a set of default pins for the I2C, SPI & UART peripherals to remain consistent with previous designs.

As an example, the Nano ESP32's SDA/SCL pins are attached to A4/A5 by default. These pins can be changed to e.g. D8,D9 if you need to use another set of pins. This is done through the mux / GPIO matrix.

### Re-Assigning Pins

You can read more about re-assigning the peripherals through the links below:
- [I2C configuration (link to Espressif docs)](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/i2c.html#i2c-api-configure-driver)
- [UART configuration (link to Espressif docs)](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32s3/api-reference/peripherals/uart.html#uart-api-setting-communication-pins)

You can also read Espressifs technical reference manual here:

- [IO MUX and GPIO Matrix (ESP32-S3 technical reference manual)](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3_technical_reference_manual_en.pdf#iomuxgpio)

## Wi-Fi®

The Nano ESP32 has a NORA-W106 module which has the ESP32-S3 SoC embedded. This module supports Wi-Fi® communication over the 2.4 GHz band.

There are several examples provided bundled with the core that showcase how to make HTTP requests, host web servers, send data over MQTT etc.

## RGB

The ESP32 features an RGB that can be controlled with the `LED_RED`, `LED_GREEN` and `LED_BLUE` pins. These are not connected to any physical pins. 

***Some boards from the first limited production batch were assembled with a different RGB LED which has the green and blue pins inverted. Read our full Help Center article [here](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/9589073738012)***

To control them, use:

```arduino
digitalWrite(LED_RED, STATE); //red
digitalWrite(LED_GREEN, STATE); //green
digitalWrite(LED_BLUE, STATE); //blue
```



## USB HID

Nano ESP32 can be used to emulate an HID device by using e.g. `Mouse.move(x,y)` or `Keyboard.press('w')`. The API documentation can be found in Arduino's language reference:

- [Keyboard API](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/keyboard/)
- [Mouse API](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/language/functions/usb/mouse/)

Several ready to use examples are also available in the core at **Examples > USB**.

## Test Pads

There are several test pads on the bottom side of the Nano ESP32. See the image below:

![Test pads on Nano ESP32](assets/nano-esp32-testpads.png)
