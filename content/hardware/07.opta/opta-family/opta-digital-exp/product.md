The **Arduino Opta® Digital Expansion** is a plug-and-play extension to the **Opta® PLC Controller** that expands its capabilities with more inputs and outputs. Two variants are available: the AFX00005 - Opta Ext D1608E (with Electromechanical Relays) and the AFX00006 - Opta Ext D1608S (with Solid State Relays), both of them fully compatible with the Arduino Ecosystem.
