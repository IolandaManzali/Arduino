## Overview

The **Arduino PLC IDE** offers the possibility to use **IEC IEC61131-3** programming languages (*LD, SFC, FBD, ST, IL*) with the **Portenta Machine Control**. The **PLC IDE** offers a wide set of standard features commonly used in the industrial automation. This tutorial will show you how to connect the **Portenta Machine Control** with the **Arduino PLC IDE**, learning how to activate the software license and the basic setup to have your board up and running with the **Arduino PLC IDE**.

## Goals

- Install the Arduino PLC IDE
- Upload the PLC IDE bootloader to the board.
- Connect to the device through the IDE
- Activate the product license
- Test the connection

### Required Hardware and Software

- Board compatible with the PLC IDE (Portenta Machine Control)
- Arduino PLC IDE ([Official Website](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/software-plc-ide))
- Unique PLC IDE License key for your device

***To get the Arduino PLC IDE and the PLC IDE License, please visit https://www.arduino.cc/pro/software-plc-ide, and  the [store page](https://store.arduino.cc/plc-key-portenta-machine-control)***

## Instructions

### 1. Arduino PLC IDE Installation

Go to the [Arduino PLC IDE official website](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/software-plc-ide), click the download button, download the two executables, ones is to get the needed libraries and cores, the other one is the program installer, as usual follow the instructions to install it on your computer. Once the installation is done, run the program, you will see the welcome screen.

### 2. Project Setup

Create a new project by clicking the middle **New project ...** button or **File > New Project**

![Create new project](assets/newProjectFullScreen.png)

![Create new project](assets/newProject.png)

After creating the project, there are some new windows on the screen, click on the left panel and switch it to the **Resources tab**, inside the window on the tree structure, click on your board and it will open the **Boards configuration page**.

### 3. Download the Runtime

The board needs to run a program (runtime) in order to interact with the **PLC IDE**. Go to the **"Other"** section below the **"Device Info"** block.

Plug your device and select the Serial Port of your board and click the **Download** button.

***The device will show up two Serial Ports, the default one (generally with lowest number) is the usual Serial Port, the secondary one (usually with highest number) is a virtual port for ModBus communication from the device to your computer. Take note of the port number assigned to the secondary port (virtual port for Modbus) as it will be needed in a second step.***

### 4. Connect to the Device

After the runtime is up and running, set up the communication by going to **On-line > Set up communication**.

On the new pop-up window open the properties of the ModBus protocol.

Make sure the Modbus protocol is using the secondary Serial port number, the ModBus Virtual port you took note of before.  Press OK.

Click ok to save the settings and press the connect button on **On-line > connect**

### 5. License Activation

If the communication is successful the main panel will show the license section to be filled in and a status indicator.

To use your product license, fill it in on the form and press the **Activate** button.

After you click the activate button, it will use the license and attach it to the board. A popup telling you to reboot the target (which is the device connected to the PLC IDE) will show up once the attachment finishes.

Once the board has been activated:
- Open the **Arduino IDE** software
- Go to **Tools** > **Board** > **Arduino Mbed OS Portenta Boards** > **Arduino Portenta H7 (M7 Core)**
- Go to **Tools** > **Port** to select the proper port (the default one shown before in the PLC IDE inside the **Arduino PMC Configuration** > **Other** section)
- Go to **Tools** > **Serial Monitor** and reset the board. Look at the end of the boot report to find the "Hardware-ID" and store it in a safe place

### 6. Download A Program

The default program that is included on a project is a counter, to upload that program to your PLC, it is needed to compile the program and send it to the target device.

### 7. Communication Test

Open the **Watch** window by clicking on "View > Tool Windows > Watch", it will attach a new window on the right side called **Watch**, this window shows the real time variables value.

To add a new variable to be watched you can click the **Insert new item** button inside the window, it will open a popup window, on the name label insert "cnt", and on the location "main", click OK and it will add the variable `cnt` from the `main` program on the table or drag and drop the cnt variable from the **Project** tree or from the **Main** program.
Select the **Watch** window and click on the **Start/Stop watch button** unless if the value of the variable is already getting updated.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial we went through how to setup the Portenta Machine Control with the Arduino IDE lab, learning how to connect the board to the program though MODBUS, activating the hardware license of your product, and creating a simple sketch with on variable that went compiled and downloaded inside the board. Finally we learned how to see the  values of the variables in real-time using the **Watch** windows.

 Now that your board is up and running with the Arduino PLC IDE, you can start to create your own professional solution.
