The MKR SD Proto Shield simply features a Micro SD card holder: the rest is up to you. You can mount smaller displays, or pack it with sensors and actuators of your own choice. It can be simply mounted on top of any MKR family board.

To use this shield, you can refer to the documentation of the [SD library](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/libraries/sd/).
