The **Arduino UNO R4 WiFi** comes with a built in 12x8 LED Matrix, that is available to be programmed to display graphics, animations, act as an interface, or even play games on. 
## Goals

The matrix and its API are developed to be programmed in a few different ways, each suited for different applications. This guide will walk you through the basic concepts for programming the LED matrix, and get you started with creating your own animations, while highlighting two different ways of handling the LEDs to create animations and images. This makes it easier for you to decide what method fits your needs best!

## Hardware & Software Needed

- [Arduino UNO R4 WiFi](https://store.arduino.cc/uno-r4-wifi)
- [UNO R4 Core](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-renesas) (latest version)
- [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Initializing Matrix
To use the LED Matrix library, there are a few things that need to be added to your sketch to get off the ground. 

First, include the library at the top of your sketch, like this:

```arduino
#include "Arduino_LED_Matrix.h"
```

Then, you'll need to create a LED Matrix object in your sketch, by adding the following line directly underneath the first one:

```arduino
ArduinoLEDMatrix matrix;
```

And then lastly, start the LED Matrix by adding this line in `void setup()`:
```arduino
matrix.begin();
```

The entire thing should look like this;

```arduino
#include "Arduino_LED_Matrix.h"

ArduinoLEDMatrix matrix;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  matrix.begin();
}
```


## How to Write a Frame
The LED Matrix library for the UNO R4 WiFi works on the principle of creating a frame, and then loading it into a buffer which displays the frame.

A frame is what we call the "image" that is displayed at any given moment on the matrix. If an animation is a series of images, a frame is one of those images in the series.

In order to control the 12x8 LED matrix on the UNO R4 WiFi, you need a space in memory that's at least 96 bits in size. The library provides two ways to do this. 

The first is simply to make a two-dimensional array of bytes like so:
```arduino
byte frame[8][12] = {
  { 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }
};
```

This option is simple to understand, because you can see the image in the pattern of the array, and it is easy to edit in runtime. The ones in the array above form a heart, and that's the image you'd see on the screen.

To target an individual pixel you select its address and change the value, remember that you'll need to start counting at 0. So, the following line will target the third pixel from the left and the second from the top, then turn it on:

```arduino
frame[2][1] = 1;

matrix.renderBitmap(frame, 8, 12);
```

This method takes more memory than is needed, however. Even though each LED needs only a single bit to store its state, you're using eight bits (a byte). The more memory-efficient method to store a frame is to use an array of 32-bit integers.

In this section we'll walk through the process and the concept of how you may create one of these frames yourself. Though we have developed a tool that can do this for you, so you can [click here](#animation-generation) if you want to skip this exercise.

Here's the same heart in that form:

```arduino
unsigned long frame[] = {
  0x3184a444,
  0x42081100,
  0xa0040000
};
```
An unsigned long variable holds 32 bits, and 96/32 is 3, so an unsigned long array is an efficient way to hold all the bits you need for the LED matrix. 

But how do those hexadecimal values relate to the positions of the pixels? To find out, convert the hexadecimal values to binary values. Here's a code snippet that will do this:

```arduino
for (int b = 0; b < 3; b++) {
    Serial.println(frame[b], BIN);
  }
```

This will print out all the bit values of the array. The output will look like this:

```arduino
110001100001001010010001000100
1000010000010000001000100000000
10100000000001000000000000000000
```

This method doesn't show you all the bits, though. Each array element should have 32 bits. If you add zeros to show all 32 bits of each element, you get:

```arduino
00110001100001001010010001000100
01000010000010000001000100000000
10100000000001000000000000000000
```
Now divide it into groups of 12 bits and you've got the heart back:
```arduino
001100011000
010010100100
010001000100
001000001000
000100010000
000010100000
000001000000
000000000000
```

***Hint: You can see the heart easier if you highlight all "1"s on the page by pressing CTRL/command + F and search for "1".***

If you've got several different frames, you can load and display them like this:
```arduino
const uint32_t happy[] = {
	0x19819,
	0x80000001,
	0x81f8000
};

const uint32_t heart[] = {
	0x3184a444,
	0x44042081,
	0x100a0040
};

  matrix.loadFrame(happy);
  delay(500);

  matrix.loadFrame(heart);
  delay(500);
```

## Testing It Out

Let's apply these concepts, with two basic sketches that display different frames on your board. First, let's create 3x32-bit integer frames and load them one by one.

Here's a sketch that will first load a smiley face on your matrix, and then change it to a heart.

```arduino
#include "Arduino_LED_Matrix.h"

ArduinoLEDMatrix matrix;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  matrix.begin();
}

const uint32_t happy[] = {
	0x19819,
	0x80000001,
	0x81f8000
};
const uint32_t heart[] = {
	0x3184a444,
	0x44042081,
	0x100a0040
};
  
void loop(){
  matrix.loadFrame(happy);
  delay(500);

  matrix.loadFrame(heart);
  delay(500);
}
```

The sketch is pretty simple, and yet the outcome is very expressive and can help you easily indicate states of your projects.

Now let's change approach and create a bitmap that we change in runtime. This sketch includes several functions that each draw part of a face, and then winks the left eye by turning off certain pixels. 

```arduino
#include "Arduino_LED_Matrix.h"

ArduinoLEDMatrix matrix;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  matrix.begin();
}

uint8_t frame[8][12] = {
  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 },
  { 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 }
};

void leftEye(){
  //Left eye
  frame[1][3] = 1;
  frame[1][4] = 1;
  frame[2][3] = 1;
  frame[2][4] = 1;
}

void wink(){
  //Wink with the left eye
  frame[1][3] = 0;
  frame[1][4] = 0;
  frame[2][3] = 1;
  frame[2][4] = 1;
}

void rightEye(){
  //Right eye
  frame[1][8] = 1;
  frame[1][9] = 1;
  frame[2][8] = 1;
  frame[2][9] = 1;
}

void mouth(){
  //Mouth
  frame[5][3] = 1;
  frame[5][9] = 1;
  frame[6][3] = 1;
  frame[6][4] = 1;
  frame[6][5] = 1;
  frame[6][6] = 1;
  frame[6][7] = 1;
  frame[6][8] = 1;
  frame[6][9] = 1;
}

void loop(){
leftEye();
rightEye();
mouth();

matrix.renderBitmap(frame, 8, 12);

delay(1000);
wink();

matrix.renderBitmap(frame, 8, 12);
delay(1000);
}
```
 
## Animation Generation
We have developed a tool that is used to generate frames and animations to be rendered on the LED Matrix in your browser. This tool is part of [Arduino labs](https://labs.arduino.cc), and is therefore considered experimental software. 

[Click here](https://ledmatrix-editor.arduino.cc) to go to the LED Matrix tool.


![LED Matrix Editor](./assets/led-matrix-editor.png)

Once you've made your animations, you can export them from the tool in the format that lets you use them like [previously discussed](#how-to-write-a-frame).

You can find more tips on how to use this tool on [its site](https://ledmatrix-editor.arduino.cc).

## Conclusion
In this article we've gone over the basics of using the LED Matrix built in on the Arduino UNO R4 WiFi, we've gone over the different practices for building frames and animations, as well as how to load them onto your board. 

Have fun creating interactive interfaces or animation on your UNO R4 WiFi!
