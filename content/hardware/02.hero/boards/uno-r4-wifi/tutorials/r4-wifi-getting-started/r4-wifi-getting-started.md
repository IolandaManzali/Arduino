To use the [Arduino UNO R4 WiFi](/hardware/uno-r4-wifi) board, you will need to install the UNO R4 WiFi board package, which is part of the [Arduino UNO R4 Core](https://github.com/arduino/ArduinoCore-renesas).

To install it, you will need the Arduino IDE, which you can download from the [Arduino Software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). In this guide, we will use the latest version of the IDE 2.

## Software & Hardware Needed

- [Arduino UNO R4 WiFi](https://store.arduino.cc/uno-r4-wifi)
- [Arduino IDE](/software/ide-v2)

***You can also use the [Web Editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor) which comes with all Arduino boards pre-installed.*** 

## Download & Install IDE

1. First, we need to download the Arduino IDE, which can be done from the [Arduino Software page](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/).
2. Install the Arduino IDE on your local machine.
3. Open the Arduino IDE.

Congratulations, you have now successfully installed the UNO R4 WiFi board package via the Arduino IDE.

## Compile & Upload Sketches

To compile and upload sketches, you can use the:
- **Checkmark** for compiling code.
- **Right arrow** to upload code.

There are several examples available for the UNO R4 WiFi board, which can be accessed directly in the IDE, through **File > Examples**. These examples can be used directly without external libraries.
