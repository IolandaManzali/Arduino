The **Portenta Hat Carrier** is an innovative solution enabling multiple robotics, industrial, and building automation projects. Combined with the Portenta X8, H7, or C33 boards, it evolves into a powerful industrial platform, further complemented by its compatibility with Raspberry PiÂ® Hats. The carrier grants easy access to an array of peripherals, such as CAN, Ethernet, microSD, USB, camera, and analog input and output ports. Its design is further enhanced with dedicated pins for efficient debugging and PWM fan connector.
