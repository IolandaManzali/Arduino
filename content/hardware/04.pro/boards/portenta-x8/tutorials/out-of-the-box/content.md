## Required Hardware and Software

* [Portenta X8](https://store.arduino.cc/products/portenta-x8) board.
* Wi-Fi AP with Internet access.
* Arduino Pro Cloud Subscription. [Learn more about the Pro Cloud](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/hardware/product/portenta-x8#pro-cloud).

***Attention: We encourage you to check every now and then if the device image version is up to date in order to have the latest bootloader, please check the tutorial [How to flash your Portenta X8](https://docs.arduino.cc/tutorials/portenta-x8/image-flashing) for instructions.***

## Connecting to the Board

Once the Portenta X8 is plugged in via USB, you can open your browser and go to http://192.168.7.1 if you use Windows and Linux or http://192.168.8.1 on MacOS. It can take up to 15 seconds for the board to boot up and make the page available. This web page is hosted on the Portenta X8, from this dashboard you will be able to:

* [Configure Wi-Fi](#connecting-to-your-wi-fi)
* [Add your device to a FoundriesFactory (OTA)](#add-a-new-device-to-your-factory)
* Board details
* Shell (alpine python)

## Connecting to Your Wi-Fi

Click the Wi-Fi button to start configuring your network connection.

![Select Wi-Fi on set up page](assets/x8-oob-main-wifi.png)

Select your Wi-Fi SSID.

![Wi-Fi ssid set up](assets/x8-oob-wifi-ssid.png)

Type the password.

![Wi-Fi password set up](assets/x8-oob-wifi-pass.png)

Once it is connected, you should see the Wi-Fi status bullet in the bottom left turning green.

***You can change your network by clicking on the button again and repeat the above steps***

## Connect to a FoundriesFactory

### Register the FoundriesFactory on Foundries.io

***The integration with Foundries.io requires the Arduino Pro Cloud Subscription, contact us at [Arduino Pro Inquiries](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/contact-us), or learn more on the [Arduino Pro Page](https://www.arduino.cc/pro/hardware/product/portenta-x8#pro-cloud)***
Go to [https://create.arduino.cc](https://create.arduino.cc) and click on Portenta X8 Board Manager, you will get prompted to set a new `Factory` name if you didn't have one before. You will not be able to be change the name later, so use one that you can remember and write easily.

![Arduino Cloud integration](assets/cloud-main.png)

It will redirect you to the FoundriesFactory registration page.

![Foundries Factory creation](assets/foundries-create-factory.png)

Then you can go to [https://app.foundries.io/factories](https://app.foundries.io/factories) and it will show the Factory you just created.

![Foundries Factories](assets/foundries-factories.png)

After you have created your FoundriesFactory you need to go back to the Portenta-X8 web dashboard to add a new device into your new Factory.

### Add A New Device To Your Factory

Click the "Register Factory name" button.

![Register Factory button](assets/x8-oob-main-factory.png)

![Factory connection](assets/x8-oob-factory-name.png)

The next panel gives you a code that you need to copy.

![Device Factory token](assets/x8-oob-factory-register.png)

Click on the "Complete registration" button on the Portenta X8 dashboard

The button will open the Foundries.io activation page. Paste your token in the text box and press continue.

![Foundries device link](assets/foundries-activation-token.png)

Confirm the addition of the new device by pressing "Connect"

![Foundries device confirmation](assets/foundries-activation-prompt.png)

Finally you will see a confirmation which means that your device now is attached to the new Factory.

![Dashboard with a Factory attached](assets/foundries-activation-success.png)

Once it is completed, the Factory button on the Portenta X8 dashboard will turn green.

![Successful connection](assets/x8-oob-factory-success.png)

#### Check Your FoundriesFactory

Have a look to your factories by going to [Foundries.io factories page](https://app.foundries.io/factories)

![Foundries.io factories page](assets/foundries-factories.png)

Select the Factory that you want to check and it will open its dashboard.

![Foundries.io Factory dashboard](assets/foundries-factory-dashboard.png)

#### Check Your Device

You can check if your device is fully connected to your Factory by going to the "devices" tab.

![Foundries.io Factory devices page](assets/foundries-factory-devices.png)

Then choose the device you want to check by clicking on its box and it will open its page.

## Controlling Portenta X8 Through the Terminal

You have plenty of ways to communicate with your board, be it wirelessly or with a cable. Next we are going to show how to use adb and ssh.

### ADB

First of all make sure you have the latest **Mbed OS Portenta Core**, which contains the adb program.

You can go to its directory inside the **Arduino15/packages/arduino/tools/adb/32.0.0**. To check the tool you can use your terminal and type `adb`, you should get feedback from the tool when typing this.

To know the list of devices that can be accessed type `adb devices`.

If you only see one device you can try and type `adb shell`, you are now communicating with your Portenta X8.

![Terminal using ADB](assets/adb-connection.png)

### SSH

SSH is commonly used for remote control on different kinds of devices running different set ups through TCP-IP.

To communicate with your board, you will need to know the IP of it, and just type `ssh fio@<IP>`, then the terminal workaround should be the same as ADB. The password is `fio`.

![SSH connection](assets/ssh-connection.png)

As it is a linux device, you can do normal stuff like creating files, changing directory, etc.

To gain admin (root) access, type `sudo su -` and the password is `fio`  after that the terminal prefix should turn red.

![CLI configured](assets/ssh-connection-admin.png)

### CLI Commands

### Connect to a Wi-Fi Access Point

Using the network manager tool `nmcli`:

`nmcli device wifi connect <SSID> password <PASSWORD>`

To check your manager connection status, use this command:

`nmcli de`

### Register Device to the FoundriesFactory

Make sure the name is not already being used in your Factory.

`lmp-device-register -n <newDeviceName>`

**Not recommended:** In case you cannot register the new device, you can erase the current device info by stopping the OTA services and removing `/var/sota/sql.db`. After these commands, you can register the device again.

`sudo systemctl stop aktualizr-lite`
`sudo systemctl stop fioconfig.path`
`sudo systemctl stop fioconfig.service`
`sudo rm /var/sota/sql.db`

### Inspecting Real Time Tasks

Run: `journalctl -f` to see what's going on on the device
